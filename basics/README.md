### Lab: 01 - Java primitives and control flow 

* It took me 4 hours to finish this lab. Still getting use to the syntax of Java.
* The one that I had most troubled with was the flinNHead method. The code is not done yet, but I am really close.
* I am not sure what to put in this README. There is no instruction on what to include in this file so I am just writing my reflection for the day. Hopefully, it's enough to get a full grade.
* Thank you TAs!
